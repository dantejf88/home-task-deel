# Deel Home Task

This is the app for the assessment task in the hiring process of Deel. The project was created with Vite, with the template for React + Typescript.

Install dependencies runing: `yarn (or your favorite package manager) install`

Then run dev with: `yarn run dev`.

Or build with: `yarn run build`.

I did not create an env var file because we are using a public API, otherwise it would be necessary to keep sensitive information protected.

I have been focusing on the user experience, and the requirement of not using any external library, implies creating many local states to cover the different use cases of an Autocomplete component. One thing I still have to do, due to time constraints, is the keyboard control of the component, which I have not been able to work on because I prefer to respect the 2 working day deadline, and I have not had the time available that I would have liked during these two days.
